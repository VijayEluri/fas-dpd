FAS-DPD:
Family Specific Degenerate Primer Design program: 

Version 1.1.1

FAS-DPD is a command line software that designs degenerated oligonucleotides to use in PCR in order to amplify new members of a family of sequences.
FAS-DPD is written in Java, so you will need a Java Virtual Machine to run it.

Usage:
	java -cp \bin;\lib\* fasdpd.FASDPD 'OPTIONS'

	Options:
		Required:
			Infile: '/infile' : Path to a Fasta file with the starting alignment.
			Outfile: '/outfile' : Path to a file where resulting primers will be stored.
			GCfile: '/gcfile' : Path to a file containg the genetic code that will be used.
		Optional:
			Length: '/len' : The length of resulting primers.
			Quantity: '/q' : The number of primers to search.
			Staring Point: '/startingpoint' : The position of the alignment where start the search.
			Ending Point: '/endpoint' : The position of the alignment where finish the search.
			Is DNA: '/isdna' : Treat the sequences in input alignment as DNA sequences.
			Is Protein: '/isprotein' : Treat the sequences in input alignment as protein sequences.
			Filter Repeated End: '/frep' : Discard primers with the last two bases repeated.
			Filter Degenerated End: '/fdeg' : Discar Primers with the last base degenerated.
			Complementary Strand: '/ComplementaryStrand' : Search the primers in the complementary strand.
			Profile: '/profile' : Generates an histogram of sites of the alignment occupied by primers. Also provides a simple script to generate '.png' and '.ps' graphic output with Gnu-Plot.
